# Java EE on Azure Workshop

This workshop will show you the many ways of effectively deploying a Java EE/Jakarta EE application to Azure. 

We will start by deploying a local Jakarta EE application to basic IaaS on Azure. We will then deploy the same application to a managed Azure PaaS. Finally we will deploy the application to Azure using Docker and Kubernetes.

We will discuss the trade-offs of each approach on the way, offering guidelines for which approach might be best for 
your application on the cloud.

At the end of the workshop, you will have first-hand exposure and be prepared to develop your own Java EE/Jakarta EE applications on Azure.
