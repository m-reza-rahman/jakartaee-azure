# Java EE on Azure Hands-on Lab

This hands-on lab will show you the many ways of effectively deploying a Java EE application to Azure. 

We will start by deploying a local Java EE application to basic IaaS on Azure. We will then deploy the same application to a managed 
Azure PaaS. Finally we will deploy the application to Azure using Docker and Kubernetes. We will discuss the trade-offs of each approach on the way, 
offering guidelines for which approach might be best for your application on the cloud.

At the end of the lab, you will have first-hand exposure and be prepared to develop your own Java EE applications on Azure.

## Key Points
* How to deploy a Java EE application on Azure using IaaS.
* How to deploy a Java EE application on Azure using PaaS.
* How to deploy a Java EE application on Azure using Docker and Kubernetes.
